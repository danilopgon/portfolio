# portfolio-2023

The 2023 version of my portfolio! _(duh)_

You can clone the "template" branch as a quickstart for your own project with **_Strapi + Next.js (w/TypeScript) + TailwindCSS + NextUI + Jest_**

By default the project uses SQLite but you can change it for any other database.

## Back-end (/api folder)

### Available commands for Strapi

```
npm run develop
Start Strapi in watch mode. (Changes in Strapi project files will trigger a server restart)

npm run start
Start Strapi without watch mode.

npm run build
Build Strapi admin panel.

npm run strapi
Display all available commands.
```

### You can start by doing:

```
cd <your project route>\api
npm run develop
```

## Front-end (/web folder)

### Next.js:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
